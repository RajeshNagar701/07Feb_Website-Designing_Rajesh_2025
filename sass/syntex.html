Why Use Sass?

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. 
This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, 
like 

variables, 
nested rules, 
mixins, 
imports, 
inheritance, 
built-in functions, 
and other stuff.


Steps to use Sass in an HTML project:

1)nstall Node.js and npm:

2)cmd :  npm install -g sass

3) create file style.scss

Write Sass code:
Populate your Sass file with Sass syntax (e.g., variables, nesting, mixins).

4)Compile Sass to CSS:
Use the Sass command-line interface to compile your Sass file into a CSS file.

    sass style.scss style.css

5) To automatically recompile 
CSS whenever changes are made to the Sass file, use the --watch flag:

    sass --watch style.scss style.css
	
6)Link CSS to HTML: 
In your index.html file, link the compiled CSS file within the <head> section:	

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
-->

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
<title>Untitled Document</title>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
